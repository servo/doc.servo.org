It tracks state such as how long the thread has been idle."],["Sleep","The `Sleep` struct is embedded into each registry. It governs the waking and sleeping of workers. It has callbacks that are invoked periodically at significant events, such as when workers are looping and looking for work, when latches are set, or when jobs are published, and it either blocks threads or wakes them in response to these events. See the [`README.md`] in this module for more details."],["WorkerSleepState","The “sleep state” for an individual worker."]]});
