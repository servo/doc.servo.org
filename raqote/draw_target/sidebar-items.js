The transform parameter can be used to adjust them to the desired location. RadialGradients have an implict center at 0,0 and a radius of 128. The helper functions: `new_linear_gradient`, `new_radial_gradient` and `new_two_circle_radial_gradient` allow the gradients to be constructed with easier to understand inputs. The `transform` parameter maps user space to source space. This means that setting the same transform on the draw target as the source will have the effect of canceling out."]],"fn":[["blend_row",""],["blend_row_mask",""],["blend_row_mask_clip",""],["build_blend_proc",""],["scaled_tolerance",""]],"mod":[["fk",""]],"struct":[["BlendRow",""],["BlendRowMask",""],["BlendRowMaskClip",""],["Clip",""],["DrawOptions",""],["DrawTarget","The main type used for drawing"],["Layer",""],["Mask",""],["SolidSource","A premultiplied color. i.e. r,b,g <= a"]],"trait":[["Blender",""]]});
