These are currently stored in a separate array to avoid bloating the size of PrimitiveInstance. In the future, we should be able to remove this and store the information inline, by: (a) Removing opacity collapse / binding support completely. Once we have general picture caching, we don’t need this. (b) Change visible_tiles to use Storage in the primitive scratch buffer. This will reduce the size of the visible_tiles field here, and save memory allocation when image tiling is used. I’ve left it as a Vec for now to reduce the number of changes, and because image tiling is very rare on real pages."],["VisibleImageTile",""],["YuvImage",""],["YuvImageData",""]],"type":[["ImageDataHandle",""],["ImageKey",""],["ImageTemplate",""],["YuvImageDataHandle",""],["YuvImageKey",""],["YuvImageTemplate",""]]});
