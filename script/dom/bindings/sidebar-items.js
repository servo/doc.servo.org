Akin to Gecko's nsMainThreadPtrHandle, this uses thread-safe reference counting and ensures that the actual SpiderMonkey GC integration occurs on the script task via message passing. Ownership of a `Trusted<T>` object means the DOM object of type T to which it points remains alive. Any other behaviour is undefined. To guarantee the lifetime of a DOM object when performing asynchronous operations, obtain a `Trusted<T>` from that object and pass it along with each operation.
